# About
**Frankenstem** is an experimental audio tool for randomly fragmenting and recombining stems into new 'frankensteined' audio files, used for sampling in music production. 
Itâ€™s designed for musicians, producers, and artists interested in playful recombination, post-authorship, and generative sound processes.

#Features 
- *Stem support*: works with vocals, drums, bass, and other instrument stems (as per Ultimate Vocal Remover (HCUS model) and Logic Pro X stem-splitter).
- *Random beat-length splicing* (configurable min/max beats)
- *Transient-based slicing* (onset detection)
- *Silence removal*: removes silent sections before slicing for cleaner results.
- *Energy-based filtering*: select segments based on very low, low, medium, or high RMS energy.
- *GUI*: simple Tkinter-based interface for non-technical use.
- *CLI / Scriptable*: fully configurable via Python for batch or experimental workflows.

# Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frankenstem.git
cd frankenstem
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Preparing input
Frankenstem expects stems in .wav format, named like:

```
Song_Name (Vocals).wav
Song_Name (Drums).wav
Song_Name (Bass).wav
Song_Name (Other).wav
```

It is advisable to export all stems you would like to recombine within one folder. This folder can be selected as the input folder. 


# TBA
Fixes:
- transient slicing accuracy

Additional features/updates:
- updated UI
- subselection from input folder
- naming convention (user generated)
- half-beats/slider for fragment length range (and one-length, no range)
- packaging as standalone app for Windows/Mac OS
